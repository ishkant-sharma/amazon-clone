## Amazon Clone (E-commerce Website)

# Overview
	This project is an Amazon Clone built using HTML & CSS, designed to replicate the core layout and functionality of the popular e-commerce website, Amazon. It provides a visually appealing user interface, showcasing a variety of product categories, including electronics, fashion, home goods, and more.
	The clone features key components of Amazon’s user interface (UI) and aims to provide an authentic shopping experience while serving as a learning project for aspiring web developers.

# Features
	•	Header with Logo and Navigation: The header contains elements like the Amazon logo, a search bar, language selection, and user options such as Sign-in and Cart. A fixed navigation bar ensures that key components are easily accessible.
	•	Search Functionality: The search bar enables users to search for products across different categories. Dropdown options allow users to filter their search by category.
	•	Product Display: Products are grouped into different categories, displayed with images, prices, and short descriptions. Each category has multiple cards that can be explored in detail (future additions), replicating Amazon's way of showcasing products.
	•	Footer with Useful Links: The footer contains several sections, including links for customer service, account management, careers, and more, which closely resemble the layout of Amazon's footer.
 
# Technologies Used
